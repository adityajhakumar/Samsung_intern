The repository "Lightweight Transformer Models for HAR on Mobile Devices" uses several well-known datasets for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). These datasets include sensor data collected from various devices such as smartphones and wearable sensors. Here are the datasets mentioned:

1. **UCI HAR Dataset**:
   - **Description**: Contains accelerometer and gyroscope data from smartphones.
   - **Activities**: Walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

2. **MotionSense**:
   - **Description**: Collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of an iPhone.
   - **Activities**: Walking, jogging, ascending stairs, descending stairs, sitting, and standing.

3. **HHAR (Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition)**:
   - **Description**: Includes data from accelerometers and gyroscopes across different devices and positions.
   - **Activities**: Biking, sitting, standing, walking, stairs-up, and stairs-down.

4. **RealWorld**:
   - **Description**: A comprehensive dataset that contains data from multiple sensors including accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and barometers.
   - **Activities**: Walking, running, sitting, standing, lying, climbing stairs, and descending stairs.

5. **SHL (Sussex-Huawei Locomotion Dataset)**:
   - **Description**: Data from smartphones carried in different positions such as the hand, bag, and pocket.
   - **Activities**: Sitting, standing, walking, running, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and various modes of transport.

These datasets provide a diverse range of activities and sensor data, making them suitable for evaluating the performance of the HART and MobileHART models across different scenarios and devices.
