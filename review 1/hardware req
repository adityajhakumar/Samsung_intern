### Explanation for Presentation:

**Sensors:**
"We need three types of sensors embedded in a mobile device:
- An accelerometer, which measures acceleration.
- A gyroscope, which measures orientation and angular velocity.
- Optionally, a magnetometer for additional accuracy in orientation."

**Availability:**
"All these sensors are available in our college labs."

**Computational Resources:**
"For computations, we need:
- An on-device CPU to run our model.
- Optionally, an on-device GPU to speed up operations and reduce computation load."

**Availability:**
"Our college labs typically have GPUs available, so we can take advantage of faster computations."

**Memory and Storage:**
"Different models require varying amounts of memory and storage:
- The CNN model needs about 51 MB of RAM and 25 MB of storage.
- The CNN-LSTM model requires around 6.5 MB of RAM and 2.25 MB of storage.
- The ViT model needs 32 MB of RAM and 15 MB of storage.
- The HART model uses about 12.7 MB of RAM and 5.9 MB of storage.
- The HARTOneMSA model requires around 8.9 MB of RAM and 5.2 MB of storage."

**Availability:**
"All these memory and storage requirements can be met with the resources we have in our college labs."

**Camera Requirements:**
"For tracking human activity using video data, we need a high-end camera with the following configuration:
- Resolution: 1080p or higher for clear and detailed video capture.
- Frame Rate: 30 frames per second (fps) or higher to ensure smooth motion tracking.
- Lens: A wide-angle lens (optional) can help capture a larger field of view.
- Connectivity: USB or built-in mobile camera for ease of use.
- Lighting: Ensure proper lighting conditions to avoid video quality issues."

**Availability:**
"Our college labs are equipped with high-end cameras, so we can fulfill this requirement as well."

**Conclusion:**
"In summary, our college labs are well-equipped to support the hardware requirements for this project, from sensors to computational resources, memory and storage needs, and high-end cameras for video capture."
